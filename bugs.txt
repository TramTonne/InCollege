Title: Experience and Education not displayed when searching for a user profile
Area: Profile Search

Instructions to reproduce bug is:
- Start with an empty accounts.dat and profiles.dat.
- Create a new user (e.g., johnsmith / MyPass!23).
- Log in as johnsmith and create a profile with About, Experience, and Education.
- Log out.
- Log in with a different user (e.g., janedoe / HerPass!45).
- From the main menu, enter 4 (Find someone that you know).
- Search for "John Smith".

- The expected result: The full profile for John Smith should be displayed, including Experience and Education entries.
- The actual result: Only the basic profile fields (Name, University, Major, Graduation Year, About) are shown. Experience and Education are missing.

Notes: This bug only occurs when searching for a person in a separate run. Viewing one’s own profile displays all fields correctly.
