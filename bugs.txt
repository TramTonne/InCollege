Title: Invalid menu choices appear immediately after creating a profile
Area: Profile Creation / Post-Login Menu

Instructions to reproduce bug:
	•	Start with empty accounts.dat and profiles.dat.
	•	Create a new user (e.g., newstudent / Pass!word1).
	•	Log in as newstudent.
	•	Complete profile creation (enter First Name, Last Name, University, Major, Graduation Year, About, and DONE for Experience and Education).

Expected result:
	•	After profile creation, the program should immediately return to the post-login menu.
	•	The user should only see the 4 valid menu options and be able to make a clean selection.

Actual result:
	•	The program displays “Invalid choice” one or more times before showing the post-login menu.
	•	This happens because leftover input (e.g., DONE or a blank line) is being misread as a menu choice.

Notes:
	•	Bug only occurs right after creating a profile.
	•	Once at the post-login menu, all options work normally.
	•	Root cause is that CREATE-EDIT-PROFILE doesn’t reset the input state, so stale input is consumed by the menu loop.
